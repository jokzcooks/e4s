# Cole Nangle

# The purpose of E4S is to utilize web technologies and curently available data sets to spread awareness for the significant issue of missing and abducted children. The website is designed with the intention of having a profound impact on the reader, such that the information presented is memorable and effectively addresses the issue. 

# The background of the page is a collage of every single missing child present in the dataset. This collage scrolls for 10 minutes straight without displaying the same individual twice. That, in itself, is extremely difficult to digest, while at the same time immediately encapsulating the viewer's attention. 

# MERN Stack + ECL

# The most time consuming part of the project by far was the implementation of the ECL language. Initial setup, data manipulation, and exporting were all difficult steps in the process. For the sake of overcomming these obstacles, it was extremely useful that the HPCC team was readily available for any and all questions.
